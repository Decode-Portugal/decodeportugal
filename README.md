# Timings and Sequencing

Opening a company is fast, but be aware that it is not as fast as advertised. 

Opening a company in here is meant as being ready to operate:
- issue invoices.
- accept payments.
- make purchases with your bank balance.
- hire people and pay them.

While there is a concept called "Company within the hour" (Empresa na Hora), in reality you can't get a company operating instantly in the meaning set above. It takes about 1 - 1.5 months before you can actually operate in Portugal.

Explain sequence.

# Power of Attorney

In Portugal, representation by Power of Attorney (PoA) is called "Procuração". A "Procuração" will enable your lawyer (or anyone else) to do operations for you. They can be used to open a company, close a company and everything in between. 

Generally the more powerful the powers enshrined in the PoA, the more specific it should be and careful you should be.

Important concepts
- local payments

```

To operate in Portugal as a company, you must open an account with a Portuguese Bank. That's mostly because there's local payment methods which are mandatory and not available in international banks.

As a way of introduction, Portugal has a banking union for payments and transactions called SIBS, who operate a brand called Multibanco (also just MB), which provides a big ATM network and local payment methods.

Local payments mean payment methods not used by other countries and not available in international banks, including online banks operating in Portugal (like Revolut).

International payment standards:
- VISA and Mastercard, both debit and credit. Accepted at most places except really small bars and shops.
- SEPA Payments with IBAN.
- SEPA Direct Debits with IBAN.

Local Payments:
- Ref MB, or Referência Multibanco. Code to make a payment of a specific amount to a specific entiy. 5 digits for the entity plus 9 digits for the payment plus the amount. Used by Utilities, the State and other companies. It's available on online bank services from PT banks and on MB ATMs. 
- MBWay: not super relevant as mostly these are B2C payments. If your business is customer facing (B2C), your clients may well request it. In that case, you can provide this type of payment via a mobile phone or a payment terminal (or web interface, but why would you). Either way, to get an address to receive the money you will need to link the MBWay service with a bank account, and currently only PT bank accounts can link to it.
- "Pagamentos ao Estado" (Payments to the State). It's a single code with 15 digits. It's available on online bank services from PT banks and on MB ATMs. It's used to pay for taxes, interest in payments, penalties and fines.
- "Taxa Social Única (TSU)" or "Pagamentos à Segurança Social" (Social Security Payments). Used to make contributions to Social Security by the company and for the employees (reduced from their income). That is a custom interface available on online banks and on MB ATMs. You usually pick the receiving identity (there's 2), a month and year, your companies fiscal IF and the amount. 

As of 2022-11-20, you can only do those in your companies online bank if the bank is a PT bank.

I have tried several banks, and I dislike the experience of all of them. The online interfaces work but are slow and confusing and it's cumbersome to manage an account with many employees and many stakeholders with a need to access it (general managers, HR, accounting). 

Opening a bank account for your business is also hard, with lots of paperwork and in-presence signing for quite some operations.

For all my companies I currently use the bank BPI, which you access on http://bpinetempresas.pt. I expect that an online first bank for companies will emerge in the coming decade.
