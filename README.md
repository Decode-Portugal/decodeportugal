# Timings

Opening a company is fast, but be aware that it is not as fast as advertised. 

In the sense of an entrepreneur, Opening a company is being ready to operate:
- issue invoices.
- accept payments.
- make purchases with your bank balance.
- hire people and pay them.

In Portugal we have a process called "Company within the Hour" ("Empresa na Hora"), which opens part of the company within 1 hour. In reality you can't get a company operating instantly with all of the elements above. Do plan that it may take about 1 month before you can actually operate in Portugal.

# Incorporation

The key elements to registering a company are the following.

1. **Where to register your company**. There's 3 separate ways for registering a company.
    - Online: It has to be a laywer doing it. It costs 225€ as of 2022-11-23. The company will have standard articles, which you can customize later.
    - Public Registration Office: You can do it without a lawyer. 360€ as of 2022-11-23. This can be done in "Conservatórias do Registo Comercial" and "Espaço de Empresas", some of which are in "Lojas do Cidadão" where you can do several operations regarding taxes and social security for persons and companies. The company will also have standard articles, which you can customize later.
    - On a Notary. This is the most expensive version, and is used for custom fillings. You will likely need a lawyer to prepare the necessary documents and will still have to pay for the Notary services and the public fees on top.
1. **Key registration documents**: A company is registered by filing the following:
    - "Pacto Social": It's a public and required document that defines the company and regulates the organization in base terms, like what is it's Purpose and who are the General Managers who can transact in its name.
        - To know: A "Pacto Social" is similar to the mandatory Articles of Association or Articles of Incorporation required in other Countries.
        - To know: The Governing body of companies registrations is the Commercial Register ("Registo Comercial") of the IRN ("Instituto dos Registos e Notariado"). The IRN is a body of the Ministry of Justice in Portugal ("Ministério da Justiça").
        - To know: To fill in the Pacto Social and therefore register your company, you will file several informations that are detailed below.        
    - CAE
    - TOC/ ROC
    - Optional: 
        - "Parassocial" or Shareholders Agreement (SHA): A private agreement regulating the internal management of the company in detail, including for example the salary of founders, board meetings and procedures, conditions for future investment rounds and decisions and more.
1. **Pacto Social**
    1. **Type, Name and Address of the company.**
        1. The organization type.
            - The commercial organization types differ mostly on the financial responsiblities signed by its shareholders or partners.
            - "Sociedade por Quotas": the typical Private Limited company, ending in name "Lda" or "Limitada". The minimum capital to start one is 1€. There's a minimum 1 partner. If you're opening a personal company with just that 1 shareholder, it's typically this type of company and then it's called a "Unipessoal Lda" or "Unipessoal Limitada" or "Unip Lda". The shares of these companies are called "quotas", which are very similar in nature to shares.
            - "Sociedade Anónima": another type of Limited company. The minimum capital to start one is 50.000€. There's a minimum of 4 registered partners. The shares of these companies are called "ações".
            - There's additional company types, among which "Sociedade em Nome Colectivo", "Sociedade em Comandita"; "Sociedade de Gestão de Participações Sociais (SGPS)" and others (european level entities). 
            - There's also Associations of several types, mostly for non-profits and other organizations of public interest.
            - You can transition companies between types, for example a "limitada" ("sociedade por quotas") can be turned into an SA ("sociedade anónima").
        2. Name:
            - You can pick the name from a pre-existing list in the go, which makes the process faster.
            - You can also pick the name yourself. There's 2 ways of doing this. Non-urgent: can take up to 15 days for an answer, and the answer can be "no", if it collides with another firms name, after which you need to start over the 15-day period. You can do a test of similarity online. You can also appeal a negative decision. It costs 75€ as of 2022-11-23. Urgent: You get an answer within 1 business day. It costs 150€ as of 2022-11-23.
            - To know: the legal name may be different from the name you use for the commercial activity. You can be called "Technical company 23, Lda" and use the name "Awesome Business". Generally, though, companies pick similar names.
            - To know: You can always change your name later, in parallel with other processes. 
        3. Adress of the Head office ("Sede"). 
            - Address for the headquarters. 
            - To know: It can be your home. It can also be your lawyers or accountant office address. Do check with them!
            - To know: It cannot be a foreign address.
    2. **Object of the company**.
        - The purpose and finality of the company. This is 1 sentence up to a few paragraphs, and generally includes standard text from the oficial codes of activity (CAE, see below).
    4. **Capital and Capital per partner.** 
        1. The initial capital with which you will start the company. You can deposit the capital when you get an account or even make a plan of committing that capital along the time, even across fiscal years.
        2. Capital allocations per partner. How much capital each shareholder has. 
        - To know: shareholders can be people or other companies. In the case that your company is a "Lda" and is a fully owned subsidiary of another company, it's still a "Unipessoal, LDA", even if the term "Unipessoal" is a direct reference to a human.
    5. **Management governance**. 
        - The rules for the people who can take executive decisions in the name of the company, meant as who can establish contracts and liabilities on the company's behalf, potentially with amounts etc. These people are the General Managers.
    7. **Appointment of General Managers**.
        - The Appoint Manager or Managers who will apply the governance, which are called "Gerente(s)" in Ldas and "Administrador(es)" in SA. They can be one or several people. They can be shareholders or not. The group of them is called the "Gerencia" (General Management) in Lds and "Administração" (Administration).
1. **Alongside the Pacto Social you will also file**
    1. **Code of Economic Activity ("CAE")** or "Código de Actividade Económica".
        - To know: The CAE is a a code which identifies your economic activity. There's a main CAE and sub-codes which you can pick, generally 3. 
        - This is quite important as these codes will define some accounting rules, like what can be expensed and not, etc.
    3. **TOC ROC** ⚠️
- Missing requirements ⚠️ NIF of persons and companies ⚠️ shareholders can be companies too (add above).
- ⚠️ With the filling of Pacto Social, you will get a NIPC and NIF of the company and an electronic Certidao Comercial. 
- ⚠️ With that, you do, in order, 1) RCBE, 2) you get RCBE code, 3) with RCBE + Certidao Permanente => open bank account. Who can do it. 4) Abrir activitidade in Social Social and Tax Office. 5) Buy a livro de atas. Buy a 6) ⚠️ if managers wont get a contract and a salary (example they are foreigners) this has to be declared in social security through a General Management decision (Livro Atas).

# Power of Attorney

In Portugal, representation by Power of Attorney (PoA) is called "Procuração". A "Procuração" will enable your lawyer (or anyone else) to do operations for you. They can be used to open a company, close a company and everything in between. 

Generally the more powerful the powers enshrined in the PoA, the more specific it should be and careful you should be. In addition, there are several levels of formality of a PoA in Portugal. 
- "Com reconhecimento de assinatura": with recognized signature of the titular of the powers to be granted.
- "Autenticada": Authenticated, recognized signature of the titular of the powers to be granted.

This authentication procedure is executed by anyone with Notary powers, which includes Notary offices and Lawyers. Check with your lawyer if they can do it.

# Banking

```
Important concepts
- local payments
- local banks
- MB, RefMB, MBWay, TSU, Pagamentos ao Estado, MB ATM
```

Summary: To operate in Portugal as a company, you must open an account with a Portuguese Bank. That's mostly because there's local payment methods which are mandatory and not available in international banks.

Payments
- International payment standards accepted in Portugal:
    - To know: In Portugal you get a pretty standard coverage of international payments.
    - VISA and Mastercard, both debit and credit. Accepted at most places except really small bars and shops.
    - SEPA Payments with IBAN.
    - SEPA Direct Debits with IBAN.
    - Wires etc possible in some banks, for big fees.
- Local Payments "standards" used in Portugal:
    - **MBWay**: less relevant as mostly these are B2C payments. If your business is customer facing (B2C), your clients may well request it. In that case, you can provide this type of payment via a mobile phone or a payment terminal (or web interface, but why would you). Either way, to get an address to receive the money you will need to link the MBWay service with a bank account, and currently only PT bank accounts can link to it.
    - **Ref MB, or Referência Multibanco**. Code to make a payment of a specific amount to a specific entiy. 5 digits for the entity plus 9 digits for the payment plus the amount. Used by Utilities, the State and other companies. It's available on online bank services from PT banks and on MB ATMs. 
    - **"Pagamentos ao Estado"** (Payments to the State). It's a single code with 15 digits. It's available on online bank services from PT banks and on MB ATMs. It's used to pay for taxes, interest in payments, penalties and fines.
    - **"Taxa Social Única (TSU)"** or "Pagamentos à Segurança Social" (Social Security Payments). Used to make contributions to Social Security by the company and for the employees (reduced from their income). That is a custom interface available on online banks and on MB ATMs. You usually pick the receiving identity (there's 2), a month and year, your companies fiscal IF and the amount. 
    - Critical: As of 2022-11-20, you can only do those in your companies online bank if the bank is a PT bank.
    - To know: Local payments mean payment methods not used by other countries and not available in international banks, including online banks operating in Portugal (like Revolut). 
    - To know: As a way of introduction, Portugal has a banking union for payments and transactions called SIBS, who operate a brand called Multibanco (also just MB), which provides a big ATM network and local payment methods. They provide unique integrations across the whole banking system, including with the State, and so the market organized around SIBS. SIBS is owned by the local Banks themselves.

Bank accounts
- You need a local bank account to operate property (see Payments).
- I have tried several local banks for Companies, and I dislike the experience of all of them. The online interfaces work but are slow and confusing and it's cumbersome to manage an account with many employees and many stakeholders with a need to access it (general managers, HR, accounting). 
- I expect that an online first bank for companies will emerge in the coming decade.
- Opening a bank account for your business is also hard, with lots of paperwork and in-presence signing for quite some operations.
    - ⚠️ process.
- Example: For all my companies I currently use the bank BPI with it's offering for companies called BPI Empresas, which you access on http://bpinetempresas.pt.
