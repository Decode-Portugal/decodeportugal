# Timings and Sequencing

Opening a company is fast, but be aware that it is not as fast as advertised. 

While there is a concept called "You can't get a company operating instantly. It takes about 1 - 1.5 months before you can actually operate in Portugal.

Important concepts
- local payments
- local banks
```

To operate in Portugal as a company, you must open an account with a Portuguese Bank. That's mostly because there's local payment methods which are mandatory and not available in international banks.

As a way of introduction, Portugal has a banking union for payments and transactions called SIBS, who operate a brand called Multibanco (also just MB), which provides a big ATM network and local payment methods.

Local payments mean payment methods not used by other countries and not available in international banks, including online banks operating in Portugal (like Revolut).

International payment standards:
- VISA and Mastercard, both debit and credit. Accepted at most places except really small bars and shops.
- SEPA Payments with IBAN.
- SEPA Direct Debits with IBAN.

Local Payments:
- Ref MB, or Referência Multibanco. Code to make a payment of a specific amount to a specific entiy. 5 digits for the entity plus 9 digits for the payment plus the amount. Used by Utilities, the State and other companies. It's available on online bank services from PT banks and on MB ATMs. 
- MBWay: not super relevant as mostly these are B2C payments. If you are customer facing, your clients may request it, for which you can receive it via a mobile phone or a payment terminal. Either way, to get an address you will need to link the MBWay service with a PT bank account.
- "Pagamentos ao Estado" (Payments to the State). It's a single code with 15 digits. It's available on online bank services from PT banks and on MB ATMs. It's used to pay for taxes, interest in payments, penalties and fines.
- "Taxa Social Única (TSU)" or "Pagamentos à Segurança Social" (Social Security Payments). Used to make contributions to Social Security by the company and for the employees (reduced from their income). That is a custom interface available on online banks and on MB ATMs. You usually pick the receiving identity (there's 2), a month and year, your companies fiscal IF and the amount. 

As of 2022-11-20, you can only do those in your companies online bank if the bank is a PT bank.

I have tried several banks, and I dislike the experience of all of them. The online interfaces work but are slow and confusing and it's cumbersome to manage an account with many employees and many stakeholders with a need to access it (general managers, HR, accounting). 

Opening a bank account for your business is also hard, with lots of paperwork and in-presence signing for quite some operations.

For all my companies I currently use the bank BPI, which you access on http://bpinetempresas.pt. I expect that an online first bank for companies will emerge in the coming decade.
